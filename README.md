# Random Javascript

This is really just some random javascript problems that I am solving on a daily basis each file will have what the problem is and and some pseudocode.




# Each File Meaning

### peoples.js
This file helps solve a problem we had at my job at Codeup when we were trying to figure out how we are going to split some of these students up without having to sit there and split them up ourselves.
So I made a program that would do this process for us. First the names will get randomized and then they are passed to another function that will split them up into  a multi dimensional array and each multi dimensional array will have a limit depending on how many groups you need.
